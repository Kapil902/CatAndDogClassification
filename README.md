# CatAndDogClassification
This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that distinguishes between cats and dogs. It utilizes a neural network model trained on a diverse dataset of cat and dog images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically extract relevant features from the input images, making it capable of accurate classification.

Setting Up Kaggle API Key:

You're creating a directory named .kaggle in your user's home directory.
You copy your Kaggle API key (downloaded from your Kaggle profile) into this directory. This key allows you to download datasets from Kaggle using the Kaggle command-line tool.
Downloading and Extracting the Dataset:

You download the "dogs-vs-cats" dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle CLI. This dataset likely contains a large number of images of both cats and dogs.
You extract the downloaded ZIP file to the /content directory.
Importing Necessary Libraries:

You import TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
You import various layers and utilities from Keras for constructing your CNN model.
Creating Data Generators:

You create two data generators using image_dataset_from_directory. One for the training data (from the train directory) and another for validation data (from the test directory).
You specify the batch size and image size for these generators.
Labels are inferred as integers (0 for cats, 1 for dogs).
Data Normalization:

You define a function process to normalize the pixel values of images to be between 0 and 1, as neural networks perform better with input data in this range.
You apply this normalization function to both the training and validation datasets using the map method.
Creating the CNN Model:

You create a sequential model using Keras.
The model consists of three convolutional layers with increasing numbers of filters, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling layers.
The convolutional layers use 'relu' activation functions.
After the convolutional layers, you add a flatten layer to transform the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
You have two dense layers with 'relu' activation and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Finally, you have an output layer with a single neuron and 'sigmoid' activation, which is common for binary classification tasks.
Model Compilation:

You compile the model using the 'adam' optimizer and 'binary_crossentropy' loss function, which is suitable for binary classification tasks.
You also specify 'accuracy' as a metric to monitor during training.
Model Training:

You train the model using the fit method, providing the training and validation datasets.
Training is performed for 10 epochs, which means the entire dataset is processed 10 times.
During training, you monitor and record various metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Visualization:

You use Matplotlib to plot the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. These plots help you visualize how well your model is learning from the data and if it's overfitting or underfitting.
Testing the Model:

You load a random cat or dog image for testing.
You resize the image to match the input size of your model (256x256).
You prepare the image for prediction by reshaping it.
Finally, you use the model to make predictions on this test image.
